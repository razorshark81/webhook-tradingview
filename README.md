A web app that will receive and print alerts from tradingview. Download ngrok and run "ngrok http 5000" after running thing.py, then the webhook url will show. It will look something like this: https://20e5-173-64-122-231.ngrok-free.app. Add /webhook to the end of it and put it in tradingview. Also, take the same URL, ttps://20e5-173-64-122-231.ngrok-free.app or whatever you got and put it in your browser to view the app.
